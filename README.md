# Clock Example

## What's The Idea?

Learn Javascript and enough geometry to do damage. 

I want to learn how to build a user interface from scratch, probably drawing into a canvas, rather than manipulating divs etc, so that I hopefully get to the position where I can, with ease and aplomb, create a UI or visualisation shot from the hip, rather than ground out of granite, something expressive rather than a meagre, souless technical compromise.


## What Will You Do?

Create a clock, that shows the myriad different ways that clocks are represented, in order to reveal the design decisions we go through, for a simple minimalist clock face, which then points at the design decisions were are making without thinking about them in all the other areas of our lives.

Why is something the way it is? Could it be better? What aren't you seeing that is there for no real reason, other than that it is.

And if these things can be there, without us seeing them? What can we be sure about?

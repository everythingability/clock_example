# Clock Example

## What's The Idea?

Learn enough Javascript and geometry to do some serious damage, to time itself. 

I want to learn how to build a user interface from scratch, probably drawing into a canvas, rather than manipulating divs etc, so that I hopefully get to the position where I can, with ease and consumate aplomb, create a UI or visualisation shot from the hip, like a deluded salsa dancer, rather than create an interface ground out of shards of melancholic granite. I want to something expressive rather than a meagre, souless technical compromise.

It'll never work of course. 


## What Will You Do?

Create a clock, that shows the myriad different ways that clocks are represented, in order to reveal the design decisions we, or someone at least goes through.  The pointers will point at the choices were are making without thinking about them in all the other areas of our lives. 

Why is something the way it is? Could it be better? What aren't you seeing that is there for no real reason, other than that it is. Smash everything and let's start with the clocks. 

If clocks can be there, without us seeing them, what can we be sure about? 

For now, I'll probably also use some jQuery.
